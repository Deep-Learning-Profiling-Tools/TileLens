"""The IR client base: lifecycle only, no analysis defaults.

An ``IRClient`` takes no part in the interpreted run: its interpreter-path
methods are inert and it declares ``NEEDS_INTERPRETER = False``, so the core
hands it compiled kernels through ``before_launch`` / ``compile_failed``,
which fill its per-launch ``ArtifactLog``. ``finalize`` is a template:
``analyze_launch(log)`` returns the reports and the verdict, also for a
launch nothing could be captured for (see analyze_launch); an ``Exception``
from it goes to ``on_analysis_error``, which returns the verdict instead (an
interrupt or ``SystemExit`` propagates).

It returns the reports followed by the verdict, which ``ClientManager``
puts into ``Launch.records``, and keeps the verdict as ``last_verdict``
(None until a launch finalizes). A subclass declares ``NAME``,
``IR_STAGES`` and ``LAUNCH``, may set ``ir_target`` (the target its kernels
are compiled for on the host; the configured default otherwise) and
implements the two hooks; statuses, refusal meanings, caches and report
printing are all its own.
