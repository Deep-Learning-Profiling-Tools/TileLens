"""Host compile: one JITFunction call compiled for a GPUTarget without a GPU.

IR mode reads the kernels Triton compiles, but the analysis is CPU work, so
the compile is too: :class:`HostCompiler` binds a call with the JIT's own
binder (``create_function_from_signature`` for the target's backend: the
signature types, i32 / i64 / u64 integers by value, the equal-to-1 and
divisibility specializations, tuples, tensor descriptors, constexprs,
``do_not_specialize``), packs it with ``JITFunction._pack_args`` and
compiles an ``ASTSource`` for the target, exactly as ``JITFunction.run``
would on a device of that target. No driver is queried and nothing is
loaded or launched: no ``get_current_device``, no stream, no
``_init_handles``. The JIT runtime's own hooks are not called either (the
function's ``pre_run_hooks``, ``knobs.runtime.jit_cache_hook`` /
``jit_post_compile_hook``, async compile mode): the host compile is no JIT
run.

The target is the caller's, whatever the machine has. While a thread host
compiles, Triton's ``driver.active`` answers that thread's target query
(``get_current_target``: what ``tl.target_info.is_cuda()`` /
``cuda_capability_geq()`` / ``is_hip()`` and the front end's own target
checks read) with the compile's target, and refuses any device query with
:class:`HostCompileUnavailable`; other threads, and this one outside its
compile, see Triton's own driver. The compile options name the target's
arch, so ``TRITON_OVERRIDE_ARCH`` does not reach a host compile either. A
compile that raises after its front end asked the driver anything (the
target, or a device query it refused and the kernel's code may have caught),
or after an earlier compile of the same kernel for the target did, says so
(:func:`target_queried`): what failed may be the target's answer. A call
that does not bind the kernel's parameters says that instead
(:func:`bind_failed`): the JIT raises the same for it on any device.

The pipeline stops after the backend's ``ttir`` passes (the same passes
``triton.compile`` runs): the front end, then TTIR, never ``ttgir`` /
``llir`` / the binary. Such a truncated compile is kept in memory only (a
``HostKernel``), never in Triton's on-disk cache, whose entries must hold
the whole pipeline. What only ``triton.compile``'s whole pipeline applies
to the TTIR is refused as :class:`HostCompileUnavailable` rather than
silently left out: ``TRITON_KERNEL_OVERRIDE``, ``USE_IR_LOC``, an
``ir_override`` compile option, and a custom pipeline
(``knobs.runtime.add_stages_inspection_hook``, which also keys the
kernel). ``TRITON_KERNEL_DUMP`` changes no stage; a host compile is just
not dumped.

A ``HostKernel`` has ``.asm`` (``"ttir"`` -> text), ``.metadata`` (a
namedtuple: ``target``, ``name``, the compile options, ...) and ``.hash``,
the specialization: what ``triton.compile`` names the kernel for that
target.

The APIs used are private to Triton. :func:`triton_api` checks that they
exist and that the front end's target queries can be scoped, and the first
compile for each target host-compiles a small built-in kernel first, so a
changed API fails as :class:`HostCompileUnavailable` naming it rather than
as an error blamed on the user's kernel. They are Triton 3.8's: on any
other release triton_api refuses (tilelens.core.config.IR_TRITON_RELEASE).
A ``CompiledKernel.__del__`` that unloads through the driver, which may run
in the middle of a host compile, reaches the machine's driver (see
_UnloadOnlyUtils).
