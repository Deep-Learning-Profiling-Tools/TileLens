        IR-client dispatch. Nothing launches: a call returns the kernel
        compiled on the host, or None when it failed to compile.

        Only the traced JITFunction instance is touched (an instance attribute,
        restored on exit). Autotuner/Heuristics layers reach it through their
        ``fn.run`` calls, so every config they warm up goes through the
        capture; IR clients get one event per distinct (specialization,
        binding fingerprint) per traced launch (see Client.before_launch).
        The compile never enters the original ``run``: ``self.compiler``
        compiles the call on the host for the IR clients' target
        (``ir_target``), no driver or device involved, so the user's
        pre_run_hooks never fire. A callable grid is resolved once more per
        captured call, for the events and the fingerprint; one that raises
        (or gives no 1-3 dim grid) is recorded as an unknown grid
        (``resolved_grid`` None), never raised here. Compiles see the
        arguments ``real_args`` maps the call to; events and fingerprints
        describe the call as made.

        A failing host compile is delivered through compile_failed, never
        raised. A host compile that could not run at all raises (or is
        caused by) HostCompileUnavailable, which tells it from a kernel's
        compile error; a compile refused while the language is patched is
        delivered as a LanguagePatchedError. Yields the CaptureWindow. A
        target spec that names no target, or IR clients that name different
        targets, raise ValueError here, before anything is compiled.

        The one host compile error raised instead is a call that does not
        bind the kernel's parameters (host_compile.bind_failed: a missing,
        extra or misnamed argument, or a call the JIT cannot key, e.g. an
        unhashable constexpr value): the JIT's binder or its cache key
        raised it, as ``JITFunction.run`` does for the call on any device,
        before any target or compile had a say, so the call raises that very
        exception before any client hears of the call. An option the
        target's backend does not know (a keyword that names no parameter)
        is no bind failure: another backend may know it, so it is a compile
        failure like any other (host_compile.unknown_options names it).

        On exit the window settles Launch.grid: the grid every kernel
        compiled during the launch shares (what the launch would have
        used), or None when configs disagree on it (a skipped autotuned
        launch picks no config). Each event keeps its own ``resolved_grid``.

        Calls from other host threads pass through untouched, and a second
        capture of the same jit_fn by another trace or thread is refused:
        concurrent traced launches sharing a JITFunction are unsupported, and
        a host compile refuses to start while an interpreted traced launch
        has triton.language patched.
